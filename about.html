<p>The author of this blog (Keegan Leitz) is a human being (he claims) with an apartment (another dubious claim) and a laptop (there is actual evidence for this). He has surrounded himself with people who are inexplicably supportive of his efforts to trash his chemistry degree and pursue his long-time (but, as of yet, <i>amateur</i>) love for coding. He may want to find new people to surround himself with, because that's a cruel prank to play on a friend. Special finger-wagging is due for his lovely girlfriend, who has done nothing but propel him forward in this pursuit. Tsk tsk. Beyond that: he is a determined, fast-learning, friendly, <i>handsome</i> man (maybe, if you can get past the narrow shoulders and narcissism, but I don't see it, personally), who is juggling a couple violently-growing obsessions with Ruby and JavaScript.</p>
